Made by Elvin Jiby in VSCode
 
A C Program that lets a user calculate their BMI, blood pressure or do a cardiac risk score assessment (ERICE risk score) based on the charts in the assignment details pdf (named assign1details.pdf)
This program shows my programming skills in C; specifically concepts like user input, input validation, functions and structured conditionals.
